after setting up the basic project , wrote the api for creating the user, but there was one issue that 
password was directly visible in the database, so we needed to encrypt it somehow.
for this we will use bcrypt -> npm i bcrypt, we will do this encrytpion in the user model js file only, before the user is actually created

for sigin process we will generate a token which we will assign to the user , for the we will use JSON web token(JWT)

next for authorisation we need to prepare a role model, that will define what role a particular user have,
so this will be a many to many assosciation because a user can have many roles and a role can belongs to multiple user
for creating many to many relationship we do this through a third table called through table, in that we store the id of both the tables
